            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <p>THe History of our Grand Thiefs Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood (like that of the Worlds Infancy) is either unknown, or wrapt up in Fables; Some stick not to report that at Four Years of Age he understood the Profound Mysteries of Pocket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diving, and that before he was Seven Years Old, none of the Neighbours durst trust their Poultry for fear of him, without Convoy; But waveing those Rumors, which have nothing to Vouch for their Credit, but the Idle Breath, and Tattling Suspitions of the Vulgar, This is certain, <hi>That when he became Capable of Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:200428:6"/>he was put forth to the Honest Laborious Trade of Brickmaking; which he followed for two or three years after the Dreadful Fire in Sixty Six, both at</hi> Knights-bridge, Soe-hoe, <hi>and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places neer the Town, and had gain'd the Creditable Repute of a Civil Industrious Young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; till happening into the unhappy Acquaintance of a Lewd Woman in St.</hi> Gileses, <hi>she seduc'd him to the Expence of his Money, and neglect of his business; and brought him acquainted with a Gang of thieves; who observing him to be a brisk bold fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low fit for their turn, soon entred him into their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety; but not till he had given a Notable proof of his Dexterity and aptness for the Calling; which was as follows:</hi> This crew had observ'd an old Fellow that kept an Ale-house near <hi>Bedford-Bury,</hi> and were satisfi'd he had good store of money, but could never understand where he laid it; For at several times they had Jilted most of his Closets and Chests, but could not meet with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing Considerable; <hi>Sadler</hi> undertakes to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover this Concealed Treasure, and by this Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem effects it; <hi>Going to Drink there one Evening, he slips up stairs and sets the Hangings on Fire; pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sently
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:200428:6"/>the Alarum is given, and he pretends to be one of the foremost in quenching it, though in truth all his business was to watch the old Dads Motions; whom he observ'd to run very surprizedly to the house of Office up three pair of stairs;</hi> The Combustion was quickly over, without much Damage at present, though the Consequence was loss e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough; For three or four Nights after, <hi>Sadler</hi> and his Confederates get into the House, and takeing up the Boards of the House of Office, under the seat find a kind of Cubboard, and therein three Hundred Pound Baggs, plentiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cramb'd with ready White; and conceiving it very unfit such Precious Mettal should be laid up so slovenly, took speedy care to remove it to a better Lodging; leaving in the place, nothing but a small pair of Horns, and a large Halter; which being discover'd about a Month after by the Reverend Miser, he decently made use of the last; not being willing to be at the charge of keeping his Soul after he had lost his Money; Whilst in the mean time <hi>Sadlers</hi> Ingenuity was much applauded by his Accomplices, and thenceforwards they all look'd upon him as a very hopeful Brother.</p>

That he could not by the Mediation of Mistris Betty, the aid of <hi>Monsieur Le Crown,</hi> nor any the like Common Arts, force an entrance; whereupon resolving to enter this Inchanted Castle what ever it cost him, he takes a Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the next Door, and in the Night gets on the Top of the designed house, and with a Rope lets himself down the Chimney into a Garret; then Rummaging what Rooms he thought fit, and pretty well Loaden with Plate and other portable Goods of Value, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairs
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:200428:7"/>to the Door, but perceives there was no getting forth; For the Master of the House always us'd to have the Keys carried up into his Chamber; In this perplexity up Stairs again he goes, hoping to escape at some Window; but made such a noise, that he wakened some of the Family, so that the whole House rung with the lamentable Out-cry; <hi>Thieves, Thieves!</hi> What to do he knew not, till the Devil and his own Natural Impudence suggested a Device; which was, <hi>Seeing some Linnen on the Top of a Chest of Drawers, he claps a Sheet all over him, and so boldly walks into the Gentlemans Chamber, who was ready with Sword and Pistol to receive him, but at his approach, concluding it a Spirit, was so frighted that he could not make use of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ither of them; so that</hi> Sadler <hi>without the least Interruption march'd by him, and opening the Window passes into the Balcony, where leaving the Sheet, he slips from thence down into the Street, and brushes off with his Booty undiscovered; whilst the honest Gentleman was saying his Prayers, and making of Crosses to defend himself from the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed walking Ghost;</hi> which in truth was as evil a Spirit as any House could be haunted with.</p>

               <p>Hearing of a kind of a Doctor of a good E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state about <hi>Hogsdon,</hi> that used to undertake the cure of Mad-men, he repairs to him in good garb, like a Countrey Gentleman, and tells him 'twas his misfortune to have a dear friend and Relation of his somewhat distempered with meloncholly, and that he was advised to him for help; The Doctor inquires how the party was taken; Upon which <hi>Sadler</hi> tells a most for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal story, that he never rav'd, but only talked a little idle now and then, and that he feared it proceeded from setting his heart too much on the World; <hi>For,</hi> says he, <hi>he is always talking of Plate and Money, and will pretend people have got it from him, and asks them to pay him, &amp;c.</hi> In short, Mr. Doctor for Twenty Guinneys would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to cure him, and the next Morning he was to be brought; But then a new difficulty is started, <hi>Sadler</hi> pretends his Kinsman so fond of him, that he should be extreamly troubled to get away from him; But the Doctor that had a salve for every sore, to help that bids him bring the young-man into the Hall, and come to him into his Study, and he would let him out
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:200428:9"/>at a back door, and then take his patient into custody when he was gone; This part of the plot being so hopefully laid, to compleat the Tragedy-Comedy, away goes <hi>Sadler</hi> to an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent Goldsmith that had some small know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Doctor, and with an innocent gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity haveing pass'd some Recommendatory complements, tells him the Doctor resolving to furnish himself with a Cubbord of Plate, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired him to send his man with such and such things, chusing as much Plate as was worth a hundred pounds, or upwards; The Goldsmith not doubting but to have a good customer, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily consents, and away goes <hi>Sadler</hi> and the young Prentice; being arrived at the Doctors Hall, he takes the Plate pretending to carry it up to the Doctor and his Lady, and bids the young-man walk a turn or two there; then keeping the prize undiscover'd under his cloak, he tells the Doctor, he had brought his Kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, desiring him to use the best of his skill up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and he would wait upon him again on the morrow, and so is let out at the back door; The Doctor very gravely comes down, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taken a serious view of his patient, takes
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:200428:10"/>him by the Wrist, and begins to Thumb his p<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>se, the Young-man wondering at his action, begins at last to inquire for the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that came with him: <hi>Ah Sweet-heart,</hi> qd. the Doctor, <hi>The Gentleman will be here presently;</hi> The Lad persisting <hi>to</hi> enquire how he lik'd <hi>the</hi> plate, <hi>Very well, very well, replies the other let not that trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble your mind; you shall have your Plate again, and I will make you as well as ever you were in your life;</hi> The Boy further asking him if he pleas'd to pay for it now; <hi>Yes, my Sweet Youth, says the Doctor, you shall have Money enough, be not dissatisfied.</hi> Then bidding him follow him, he takes him into 2 dark room, and calling some of his Servants, falls to bleeding of him Lustily, and shaves off all his Hair; The Youth made many Protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions against these Proceedings, telling whose Man he was, and how, and upon what account he came thither, but all in vain, for they inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted these discourses, as extravagant Effects of his distempered Brain; &amp; presently clapt him into a Bed contrived for the purpose, &amp; lock'd him down fast, and went on so dexteriously, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Method of Art, to cure his sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed Lunacy, till they had almost made the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:200428:10"/>fellow stark Mad in earnest; The Gold-smith hearing no News of his Return, gets up next Morning by break of day, and comes to the Doctors in Quest of him; And then the Cloud was opened, &amp; they fairly perceived how fouly they were Cheated.</p>
